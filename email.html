        <h2>Email: Home vs Work</h2>

        <section>
            
            
        <p> A good advice to follow is this: Work emails should be separated from home emails. What that means is you should not 
            have Netflix, Hulu, Facebook, and bank emails to name a few, associated with your work email. Threat actors use a emails for click baits to 
            lure their target to clicking on a link either to gain information (enumeration) or to plant something malicious. The reason why I add this is because
            when I perform a Phishing campaign the majority of what I see is clients clicking on things that shouldn't be associated in a work email.
