        <h2>Password Protection</h2>

        <p>For the sake of Client protection, I Will omit the names. Within my time in the Cyber professon,I have seen
            may of my client use a password that is either easy to remember, associated it to their personal lives, use their user name the same as their 
            password, leave a password on the default given, and write the password leaving it near by.<br>

        <h3>SO!?!? Whats the Point </h3>
        <p>The point is that you should avoid everthing that was mentioned above. There are other method/procedure that ca be taken to safeguard
            passwords. But its human nature to try to make things easier for us. This can reflect the CIA model, which stands for confidentiality, Integrity and availability and is used
            within an organization for the purpose of information security, Which does not mean we cannot use for ourselves. Follow the links below to find out more information on the topic.
