        <h3>Multifactor Authentication (MFA)</h3>

        <p>One of the best type of security a person can have is Multifactor Authentication. We hear the term but some that are not tech savy and don't understand
            the function of it. It is the presents of two forms of things on you person. Here we will break down its use, provide examples, and provide guildance. 
            By the end of this we will have a better understanding how to properly secure ourselves and our clients.  
            </p>

        <h3>What Is This About</h3>

        <p>As the name suggests it is a multiple form of authentication, what that means is: lets says you want to login to your email, for example your Gmail account and you have 
            enabled the function. Google will use their application that randomizes numbers for you to input after successfully providing a password. Seems like much
            but now and days people use passwords that are easy to guess, making them vulnerable of their information. Another perfect example that should reflect us all
            is Georgia Southern login to your account. Again, Once you provide the information to login you are prompted with DUO, which gives you three options for sign in.

        <h3>The DownSide</h3>
        <p>As like many vulnerabilities threat actor has been able to bypass this. Social engineering is one method, which can be summarized as reconning someone extensively and the 
            other easy method is called a "Push Attack," which is once the threat actor has gain access to the passcode, they will proceed to bombard you phone to cause nuisance until
            the victim finally just accepts or accidently accepts so they are no longer disturbed or interrupted.
