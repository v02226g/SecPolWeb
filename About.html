            However, there is the other side of the human factor which we sometimes overlook, either deliberately or because of lack of training<br> 
            or understanding how the attacker thinks or their methods they target, or motivation.This page is to help you understand the<br>
            mentioned form of attacks and how we can become better at avoiding or becoming a target.
